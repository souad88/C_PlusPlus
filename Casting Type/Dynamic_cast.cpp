//Uses of Dynamic_Casting:-
// When we dealing with an abstract interface class( Polymorphism) 
//then we have to use aPOINTER to point to a base class ,but we want to access only the information
//in  the derived class.
//-------------------------------------------
//Then we have:- 1-Base class Interface-class with methods.
//               2-Derived class .
//               3- apointer to  a Base class.
//               4- Apointer to abase-class.
//               5- Dynamic casting to use the ONLY-INfOrmations  in the derived class without
